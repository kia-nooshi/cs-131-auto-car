## Description

Created a self-driving RC car collaboratively with a team of four, employing Python, Machine Learning, middleware layers, and Google Cloud services. The project focuses on achieving autonomous driving capabilities while continuously collecting real-time data to identify and address traffic congestion and road blockages, ultimately optimizing route selection for all vehicles within the network. Our development process adhered to agile principles and encompassed comprehensive system testing.

## Middleware Setup

1. Setup a python virtual enviorment (technically optional)
    a. https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
    
2. Change directories to middleware folder

3. install requirements

```pip install -r requirments.txt```

Setup is all done, you can now run the middleware files
